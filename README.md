<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Style My Dialogue is a Streamlit app and workflow that allows users to style a given dialogue based on the characteristics of a chosen character. The app uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API and CLIP model to classify the image of a character and generate a styled dialogue that matches their characteristics.

Contributions are:
* Automatic naration and storytelling: This app can be used as a tool to help writers and storytellers generate new ideas and dialogue for their stories, and to explore different character personalities and styles.
* Showcasing the power of AI in dailouge generationg and stylization: This app demonstrates the capabilities of cutting-edge natural language processing and computer vision models to generate context-aware and creative dailouges.
* Providing a fun and interactive way for users to experiment with these models: By allowing users to upload their own images and enter their own dialogues, this app enables users to play with the models and see their outputs in real-time.
